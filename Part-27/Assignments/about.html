    <h1>About My Learning Website</h1>
    <p>This website is designed to teach the basics and advanced concepts of HTML. Starting with headings and paragraphs, we gradually move into more complex topics. <br/> <br/>
    HTML lists are essential for organizing content. We have covered <em>ordered lists, unordered lists</em>, and <em>definition lists</em> to create well-structured information. <br/> <br/>
    Understanding <mark>image paths</mark> is crucial. We have explored relative paths for local files and absolute paths for external resources. This knowledge is key for web development.
    </p>
    <h2>Text Formatting</h2>
    <p>HTML provides various tags to format text, like <strong>bold</strong>, <em>italic</em>, and <sup>superscript</sup>. Use these to make your content engaging. <br/> <br/>
        We also explored how to add <del>removed</del> text and <ins>inserted text</ins>, giving us flexibility in how we present information. Using the <span style="color:red">style attribute</span>, we can easily change text color and background color.
