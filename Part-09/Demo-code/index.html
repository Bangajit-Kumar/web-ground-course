<h1>Life of an Ant and a Spider</h1>
<hr />
<p>Behind the bush, upon the mound,<br /> ants are moving without a sound. <br />Leaves are passed along the chain, <br />where ants are lined as one.</p>
<p>Strands of silver make its net, <br />a fly is caught in its web; <br />Now itâ€™s too late, <br />the spider comes to seal its fate.</p>

<p>They march on to feed the queen, <br />deep below she lays unseen. <br />Workers feed the silent drones, <br />in their capsule breeding zones.</p>
<p>The spider shoots its webs to reach, <br />across the ever-widening breach. <br />Swinging on a single thread, <br />beyond the gap, the web is spread</p>
